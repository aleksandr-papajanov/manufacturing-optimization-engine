note right of Engine
  Long-running, asynchronous process.
  Waits for external events:
  - provider proposals
  - customer strategy selection
end note

note bottom of Pipeline
  Orchestrates workflow:
  matching → estimation → optimization
  → confirmation → plan creation
end note

note top of Gateway
  Stateless HTTP API.
  Persists user-visible state
  and exposes polling endpoints.
end note
